00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Imagine you're playing basketball. You throw the _*basketball*_, right? It goes

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,788
up in the air, then comes back down. That's projectile motion!

3
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:16,004
It's how things move when you throw or shoot them.

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:22,751
So, the _*basketball*_, when it leaves your hand, it's going forward and

5
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:28,816
up. But gravity is pulling it down, like an invisible force. That

6
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:33,481
makes it go in a curved path, called a trajectory.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,584
It's like if you rolled the _*basketball*_ down a _*ramp*_, it wouldn't go

8
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:50,564
straight, it would go in a curve because of the _*ramp*_'s shape.

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:54,726
That's projectile motion in a nutshell! Things go up,

10
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:58,414
then down, in a curved path because of gravity.
