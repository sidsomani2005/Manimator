00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,443
Imagine you're playing with a ball. You throw it up

2
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:06,569
in the air. What happens? It goes up, then it

3
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:11,085
comes back down, right? That's called projectile motion. It's the

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,420
way things move when they're thrown or launched.

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:17,980
Let's break it down. When you throw the ball, you

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,111
give it a push. That's its initial velocity. But gravity

7
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:25,430
is also working on the ball, pulling it down.

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:30,789
So, as the ball goes up, gravity slows it down. Then, it stops for

9
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:36,622
a moment at the highest point, and gravity starts pulling it back down.

10
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,974
It's like when you throw a basketball onto a table.

11
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,513
It bounces up, then falls back down. Projectile

12
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:46,230
motion is like that, but in the air!

13
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:50,584
So, projectile motion is when something goes up, then comes

14
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,702
back down, because of gravity. It's all about that push

15
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,398
you give it and the pull of gravity.
