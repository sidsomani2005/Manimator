1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
Let's explore subtraction.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,300
Imagine you have a plate with 5 cookies on it.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,020
Each cookie represents one item in our total count.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,260
Now, let’s say you eat 2 of these cookies.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,908
We’ll start by taking away 2 cookies from the plate..

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:21,164
As each cookie is removed, our total number of cookies decreases.

7
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:25,244
After removing 2 cookies, let’s count how many are left.

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,580
We began with 5 cookies and removed 2.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,700
Now, there are 3 cookies left on the plate.

10
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,929
This shows that 5 minus 2 equals 3

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,452
You now have 3 cookies left!
