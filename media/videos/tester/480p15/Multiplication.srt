00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,173
Multiplication is like a shortcut for adding

2
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,852
the same number over and over again.

3
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:08,939
Imagine you have a basket of apples. Let's

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,732
say there are 3 apples in each basket.

5
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:16,940
Now, if you have 4 baskets, how many apples do you have in total?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,916
Instead of adding 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, we can simply multiply!

7
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:26,432
We multiply the number of apples in each

8
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:29,948
basket (3) by the number of baskets (4).

9
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:35,300
So, 3 x 4 = 12. You have 12 apples in total!
