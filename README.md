## Overview

**Manimator** is an multi-agent LLM animation tool designed to create engaging educational videos on any topic. Whether it's visualizing complex mathematics or explaining the fundamentals of blockchain, Manimator transforms intricate subjects into concise, accessible clips for audiences of all ages. 
<br></br>

## How Does It Work?

Manimator utilizes a five-stage agentic LLM processing flow, along with state of the art image generation and text-to-speech technologies to effectively construct clear and cohesive animations based on user prompts.

**Anthropic Claude:** the model used for the manim script generating agent
**Vertex AI:** used for text-to-speech conversion and assitance for Gemini 1.5 Pro throughout the JSON object propagation flow
**Gemini 1.5 Pro:** the model used for reranking, and propagation of JSON files/objects from one agent to the next
**Google's Imagen 3:** the model used for image generation for icons and analogical video generation
**Google Cloude Platform Buckets:** utilized buckets to store images and png files generated by Google's Imagen 3
**Scrapy:** used to create the web scraping pipeline to construct the mini-library of manim code referenced by the scripting model
**Streamlit:** used to design the intuitive UI
**Docker:** used to containerize the project into an environment that enabled cohesion of above technologies
